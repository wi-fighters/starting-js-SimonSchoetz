//1

let name = "Simon Schötz";
name = "You wot m8!";
//console.log(name);

//2
//console.log("Schm" + name);

//3 It still will be a string but adding "Schm" doesnt change the value of name
//console.log(typeof "Schm" + name);

//4
console.log(name); //Well, the first value is reassigned by the reassign thingy so actually, there are no 2 different values at the end..... . . . .. .
